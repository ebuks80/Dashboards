This project is aimed at creating a dashboard to vidualise a call centre's data. The problem statement gotten from the client is:
I'm looking for transparency and insight into the data we have here at the call centre.
For example, total number of calls answered and abandoned, speed of answer, length of call, overall customer satisfaction etc.
What i am after is an accurate overview of long term trends in customer and agent behaviour.
I will be creating a dashboard in Power BI that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.
The dataset is provided as an excel file, the Power BI file is also available for you to interact with if you have the software to open it
and if you don't have the software to interact with it, i have a pdf file that shows what the dashboard looks like.
My understanding of the problem is, there is a call centre with agents who answer the calls, now the boss wants to know details such as the ones above, he wants to know this as a whole and for each individual agent.
To solve this, i created a dash board in with Power BI, you can see a drop down menu that shows the different agents and you can click on any of them to see their work stats, or you can pick all to see the over all stats.
you can see score cards showing, phone calls resolved, unresolved, answered, unanswered, response time, total talktime, average talktime and average customer rating.
you can see charts like 'daily call traffic' to see how much calls come in on different days of the week, 'Topic' to see the topic of discussion, 'Hourly call traffic' to see the rate of calls at different hours of the day, 'monthly call traffic' to see the rate of calls at evryday of the month
I did my best to make the dashboard as clear and simple as possible
